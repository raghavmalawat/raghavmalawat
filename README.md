### Hi there 👋


Hello 👋, I'm Raghav Malawat, a FullStack developer based out of Bengaluru, India. Taking a first principle approach to building products interests me, and metrics is something I really like moving.
 
Always up for conversations around the Indian equity markets and the startup ecosystem in general 🚀. Currently working as a Product engineer alongside amazing folks at CoLearn. 

I have always been fascinated by coding and problem solving in general, been coding since age 14. Crossed paths with a lot of smart, hard working folks till now in the industry and hope to meet more similar folks who are as equally passionate about their craft as I am. Cheers 🍻!
